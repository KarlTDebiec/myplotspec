Plot Toolkit is a set of python functions, classes, and decorators intended to
simplify usage of the matplotlib package. Matplotlib provides an excellent
framework for rapidly generating plots using python. However, applying strict
formatting specifications to these plots requires writing a large amount of code
that is difficult to read and difficult to remember. Plot Toolkit's purpose is
to allow users to generate plots with strict formatting specifications using
matplotlib, without writing large amounts of complex code.
