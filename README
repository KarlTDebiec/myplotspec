Plot Toolkit is a set of python functions, classes, and decorators intended to
simplify usage of the matplotlib package. Matplotlib provides an excellent
framework for rapidly generating plots, however, applying strict formatting
specifications to these plots requires writing a large amount of code. Plot
Toolkit's purpose is to reduce this.
