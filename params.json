{"name":"MYPlotSpec","tagline":"Powerful plot configuration using matplotlib and YAML","body":"Introduction\r\n============\r\n\r\nMYPlotSpec is a Python package used to design matplotlib-based figures using\r\nthe simple text format YAML.\r\n\r\nMYPlotSpec may be used to rapidly write programs for plotting particular types\r\nof data while retaining detailed control over plot configuration. The minimal\r\n'quick & dirty' code needed to plot a certain type of data should be very close\r\nto the polished code used to produce publication-quality figures featuring\r\nprecisely chosen proportions, ticks, colors, and fonts. MYPlotSpec accomplishes\r\nthis by offering a system for routing arguments provided in YAML format to\r\nmatplotlib's existing formatting functions. Settings may be applied globally or\r\nrouted to specific figures, subplots, and datasets. MYPlotSpec should have no\r\nconflict with existing matplotlibrc settings, instead offering a level of\r\nspecific control on top of them. MyPlotSpec supports a system of defaults and\r\npresets that make it easy to prepare multiple versions of plots without\r\nchanging code, such as for a lab notebook, printout, or presentation.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nMYPlotSpec supports Python 2.7 and 3.4, and requires the following packages:\r\n\r\n- matplotlib\r\n- numpy\r\n- six\r\n- yaml\r\n\r\nMYPlotSpec has been tested with Anaconda python 2.1.0 on Arch Linux, OSX\r\nYosemite, and Windows 8.1.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPut in your ``$PYTHONPATH``::\r\n\r\n    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/my/python/modules:$PYTHONPATH\r\n\r\nwhere ``/path/to/my/python/modules`` contains ``myplotspec``.\r\n\r\nAuthorship\r\n----------\r\n\r\nMYPlotSpec is developed by Karl T. Debiec, a graduate student at the University\r\nof Pittsburgh advised by Professors Lillian T. Chong and Angela M. Gronenborn.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nReleased under a 3-clause BSD license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
